                        extensive training, ruthless mental and physical
                        conditioning, and mysterious rituals in
                        preparation for becoming an itinerant monster slayer for hire. Geralt, the central character in
                        Andrzej Sapkowski's Witcher series and the subsequent games inspired by them, is said in the
                        stories
                        to be one of the greatest witchers; he is certainly legendary, but whether famous or infamous is
                        more open to interpretation .</p>

                            <p class="_anim-show">The Witcher is a series of six fantasy novels and 15 short stories written by Polish
                                author Andrzej Sapkowski. The series revolves around the eponymous "witcher," Geralt of
                                Rivia. In Sapkowski's works, "witchers" are beast hunters who develop supernatural
                                abilities at a young age to battle wild beasts and monsters. The Witcher began with a
                                titular 1986 short story that Sapkowski entered into a competition held by Fantastyka
                                magazine, marking his debut as an author.</p>
